# InvalidLauncher
## What is Invalid Launcher?
Invalid Launcher is a custom launcher for DangerZone, the point of this project is to create a much more convenient experience to the user than the one the current official launcher provides as it is only supports one version of of the game at time, doesn't allow the user to select which mods it wants to use and the UI is quite ugly.

### Planned Features:
- Support of multiple versions at once;
- Unlimited profiles with each being bound to one DZ version;
- Multiple profiles will be able to have the same version allowing you to organize your DZ experience to suit your needs;
- Convenient launch for multiple DangerZone instances;

## Why "Invalid Launcher"?
Because I'm known on the DZ community as "InvalidName", so "Invalid Launcher" would be an launcher mabe by InvalidName
